## Daily Workflow for Updates

### 1. Making Changes
When you make changes to your project:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "c:\Users\Admin\AI-training\Askme"

# Check what files have changed
git status

# See detailed changes
git diff
```

### 2. Adding and Committing Changes

```bash
# Add all changed files
git add .

# Or add specific files
git add filename.py

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add new feature: voice response improvements"
```

### 3. Pushing to GitHub

```bash
# Push your changes to GitHub
git push origin master
```

## Common Git Commands

### Checking Status
```bash
git status              # See what files are changed
git log --oneline -10   # See recent commits
git remote -v           # See remote repository URL
```

### Working with Changes
```bash
git add filename.py     # Add specific file
git add .               # Add all changed files
git commit -m "message" # Commit with message
git push                # Push to GitHub
```

### Viewing Changes
```bash
git diff                # See unstaged changes
git diff --staged       # See staged changes
git show                # See last commit details
```

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
- Examples:
  - "Add PDF processing for educational content"
  - "Fix audio playback issue in web interface"
  - "Update model training documentation"

### When to Commit
- After completing a feature
- After fixing a bug
- Before making major changes
- At the end of each work session

### File Management
- Keep sensitive data out of Git (API keys, personal info)
- Use `.gitignore` for temporary files
- Regularly push changes to avoid data loss

## Repository Structure
Your current repository includes:

```
Askme/
├── README.md                 # Main project documentation
├── main.py                   # Core application entry
├── nia_launcher.py          # Child-friendly interface
├── requirements*.txt        # Dependencies
├── configs/                 # Configuration files
├── data/                    # Educational data
├── docs/                    # Documentation
├── education/               # Educational processing tools
├── scripts/                 # Setup and utility scripts
└── src/                     # Source code modules
```

## Sharing Your Repository

### Public Repository
Your repository is likely public, which means:
- ✅ Anyone can view your code
- ✅ Great for sharing educational projects
- ✅ Builds your coding portfolio
- ❗ Ensure no sensitive data is included

### Repository URL for Sharing
Share this URL with others: **https://github.com/SunenaB3504/Askme**

## Troubleshooting

### If Push Fails
```bash
# Pull latest changes first
git pull origin master

# Then push your changes
git push origin master
```

### If You Need to Reset
```bash
# Undo last commit (keeps changes)
git reset HEAD~1

# Discard uncommitted changes
git checkout -- filename.py

# See what will be discarded
git status
```

## Next Steps

1. **Regular Backups**: Push changes to GitHub regularly
2. **Documentation**: Keep README.md updated with new features
3. **Releases**: Create releases for major versions
4. **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues to track bugs and features
5. **Collaboration**: Invite others to contribute if needed

git push                # Push to GitHub

# Emergency commands
git stash               # Temporarily save changes
